# Forked from ruthealee/RHCSA-cheat-sheet which, when I wrote this comment, was last updated in 2014.
# The bulk of this work was done by ruthealee who deserves the preponderance of credit.
# I'm updating this list for the rhcsa exam objectives located here: https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam?section=Objectives
# I left some of the objectives that were not present in the latest objectives list (08/30/2022 at link above) out of an abundance of caution and paranoia.
# Can I study too much? I think not.
# I've marked the old objectives accordingly for the reader's awareness. Ctrl+F for "old" (case insensitive).... Ctrl+G and Ctrl+Shift+G cycles down and up through results.
